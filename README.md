# Sensing the Weather

![](cover.png)

This scheme of learning introduces students to the Raspberry Pi Weather Station, a project which aims to get schoolchildren building and programming their own weather station to collect and present data. This is the first of a series of activities which introduces some simple sensors and gets the students writing Python code to gather data from them. 

## Lessons

- [Lesson 1 - Why and how we collect weather data](lesson-1/lesson.md)
- [Lesson 2 - Sensing inputs from hardware](lesson-2/lesson.md)
- [Lesson 3 - Measuring rainfall using polling and interrupts](lesson-3/lesson.md)
- [Lesson 4 - Calculating wind speed](lesson-4/lesson.md)
- [Lesson 5 - Putting it all together](lesson-5/lesson.md)
